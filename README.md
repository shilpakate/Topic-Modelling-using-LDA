# Topic-Modelling-using-LDA


Topic Modeling is a technique to extract the hidden topics from large volumes of text. Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) is a popular algorithm for topic modeling with excellent implementations in the Pythonâ€™s Gensim package. The challenge, however, is how to extract good quality of topics that are clear, segregated and meaningful. This depends heavily on the quality of text preprocessing and the strategy of finding the optimal number of topics. This tutorial attempts to tackle both of these problems
